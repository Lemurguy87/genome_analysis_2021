# genome_analysis_2021
GitHub repository for laboratory/project work in the course genome analysis. Taken 2021
The aim of this project is to discover the metabolic roles in bacterioplankton from the Northern Gulf of Mexico’s dead zone. In order to do so there are goals in place that should be met in a specific order. 

These goals are as follows: 
The reads shall be preprocessed
The metagenome shall be established 
Binning of the metagenome as well as quality check of the bins and metagenome 
Basic phylogenetic placement of bins followed with a functional annotation. 
Lastly an analysis of expression levels in the different bins 

If time allows for it, these analyses shall be followed with more advanced analyses, not mentioned in any specific order: 
Measure the abundance of the different organisms and refine the initial taxonomic placement  
Metabolic pathway reconstruction for the chosen bins 
Analysis of the expression data 
Comparison across the different bins as well as comparative genomics of each bin and ortholog gene clustering of the bins. 

Below is a step by step guide of what will be done to the original data to reach each goal, as well as which software will be used. 
Step 1: 



Types of samples: 

The original samples from Thrash et. al. originated from a different region in the Northern Gulf of Mexico “dead zone”. This genome analysis project will use the genomic data derived from Thrash et. al. article.
