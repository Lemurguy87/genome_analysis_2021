Ran the first analyses, FastQC, for all the files, both DNA and RNA. The RNA sequences seem to have terrible amounts of contamination and faults, after reviewing their FastQC reports.
The DNA sequences are not as bad, however their per sequence GC content scores are nothing to write home about. I will trimm both types of data i.e. trim the DNA and RNA sequences. 
This is in hope of ironing out the observed faults. After some discussion with a TA, Daria, I am not as convinced to use Sickle for trimming. 
While Sickle could work, Daria mentioned that it is not as common as Trimmomatic. If something were to go wrong with Sickle, I'd need to troubleshoot it by myself, while others in my group use Trimmomatic. 
For this reason, since I have no experience in genome analysis, I will use Trimmomatic instead of Sickle, as I could rely on others to help me in troubleshooting.
